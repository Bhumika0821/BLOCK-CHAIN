# BLOCK-CHAIN
Algorithm used : PROOF OF WORK

**wallet.py ** Consists of the private and public key generation.

**verify.py** verifies the block hash with a computational problem.

**blockchain.py**
-> Consists the consensus algorithm
-> First block is created
-> Block is added
-> Checks if the block isvalid
-> Mines block's

Core of the blockchain

INORDER TO RUN THE BLOCKCHAIN RUN :

**>python fullnode.py**


Import the following libraries :

-> time
-> logging
-> uvicorn
-> requests
-> asyncio
-> sys
-> rsa
-> binascii

**Output :**
Code has been updated to print the blockchain which is stored in a list data structure after every block is mined.

The public key , private key and previous and current block hash is printed with each added and mined block.

A Screenshot of the output has been uploaded in the reposistory as **"Output.JPG" **
