# BLOCK-CHAIN
Algorithm used : PROOF OF WORK<br />

wallet.py  consists of the private and public key generation.<br />

verify.py verifies the block hash with a computational problem.<br />

blockchain.py<br /><br />
-> Consists the consensus algorithm<br />
-> First block is created<br />
-> Block is added<br />
-> Checks if the block isvalid<br />
-> Mines block's<br />

Core of the blockchain<br />

INORDER TO RUN THE BLOCKCHAIN RUN :<br />

>python fullnode.py<br />


Import the following libraries :<br />

>time <br />
>logging <br />
>uvicorn <br />
>requests<br />
>asyncio <br />
>sys <br />
>rsa <br />
>binascii <br />

Output : <br /><br />
Code has been updated to print the blockchain which is stored in a list data structure after every block is mined. <br />

The public key , private key and previous and current block hash is printed with each added and mined block. <br /><br />

A Screenshot of the output has been uploaded in the reposistory as "Output.JPG"<br />
